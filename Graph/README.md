# Algorithms_Data_Structures

While including all the components of HashTable and B_Tree, this project also includes a graph! It functions as a connectivity check between all the websites to ensure no rogue mistakes were made. This also displays graphically the shortest path between any two selected webpages. Please note, this project loads 500 URLs and saves persistently on the machine!

Key implementations upgraded in this project:

* Persistent Graph
* Number of disjoint sets calculated from graph
* Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate shortest path
