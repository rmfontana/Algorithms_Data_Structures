# Algorithms_Data_Structures

All three projects build off of each other to showcase specific algorithms and data structures. See readme in each individual project folder for more details. Each file inside of the folders are classes of the same project. 

To run project, put into your favorite java editor or follow the following steps for command line:

    javac foldername.java
    java foldername

Key implementations in these projects:

* JavaFX GUI
* Resizeable and persistent HashTable *from scratch*
* Webscraping with Jsoup
* Web Crawling
* tf-idf (Term frequency-inverse document frequency) similarity metrics
* Persistent File-based B-Tree *from scratch*
* Fixed size buffer cache
* 5 cluster categorization with kmeans metric
* Persistent Graph *from scratch*
* Number of disjoint sets calculated from graph
* Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate shortest path
